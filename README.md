# Data Science Portfolio

A collection of machine learning and data science projects completed as part of my Postgraduate Diploma in Data Science at the **University of the Witwatersrand**.

## ðŸ“‚ Projects

### 1. Neural Network Classifier â€“ Iris Dataset
- Built and trained a feedforward neural network to classify iris flower species.
- Applied min-max normalization and one-hot encoding.
- Achieved over 95% test accuracy using Scikit-learn.

### 2. Random Forest Classifier â€“ Rice Dataset
- Implemented a random forest classifier to distinguish between Cammeo and Osmancik rice varieties.
- Evaluated model using accuracy, precision, recall, sensitivity, and F1 score.
- Achieved over 97% accuracy.

### 3. Multivariate Imputation â€“ Air Quality Dataset
- Used chained equations (MICE) to fill missing pollutant readings in an air quality dataset.
- Preserved extreme peaks while ensuring data completeness for environmental health modeling.

### 4. Income Prediction using PySpark
- Built a distributed ML pipeline in PySpark to classify income levels using decision trees and feature engineering.
- Achieved 84% accuracy while handling both categorical and numerical features efficiently.
