## 🧩 Qualitative Analysis of High-Visibility Tweets

### Method
A subset of **12–15 tweets** was selected from:
- Peak periods of protest activity, and/or
- Tweets authored by highly mentioned or influential users

These tweets were identified using:
- Temporal spike detection
- Mention and retweet network metrics
- Engagement indicators (visibility within the network)

### Analytical Focus
Each selected tweet was analysed to determine:

1. **What the tweets do**
   - Mobilise protest participation
   - Attack political leadership
   - Express solidarity and shared grievance
   - Call for accountability or action
   - Amplify emotionally charged narratives

2. **Why they gained attention**
   - Emotional resonance
   - Strategic timing during protest peaks
   - Author credibility or network centrality
   - Clear framing, slogans, or calls to action
   - Network amplification effects

3. **Reflection on digital methods**
   - Digital tools efficiently surfaced influential content
   - However, qualitative interpretation was essential to understand meaning, intent, and context
   - Automated methods alone cannot fully capture irony, symbolism, or political nuance

## ❤️ Question D: Sentiment Analysis and Narrative Frames

### Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis was applied to the dataset to examine the emotional tone of protest discourse. The sentiment distribution was visualised to show:
- Predominance of negative sentiment linked to grievance and outrage
- Presence of positive sentiment associated with solidarity and resistance
- Neutral sentiment linked to information sharing

---

### Narrative Frame Detection
Seven dominant narrative frames were identified and visualised using bar charts / word frequency plots. These frames were derived inductively from the dataset (not copied from the prompt examples).

Examples of detected frames include:
- Accountability and leadership critique
- State violence and repression
- Collective identity and resistance
- Justice and human rights
- Youth mobilisation
- Protest legitimacy
- Political change

These frames reveal how protest discourse constructs **“us vs. power”**, legitimises resistance, and sustains mobilisation.

---

### Missing Voices and Limitations
The analysis reflects important gaps, including:
- Underrepresentation of rural communities
- Limited visibility of Swahili or vernacular-language tweets
- Absence of offline protest voices
- Platform bias favouring digitally connected, urban users

These exclusions imply that Twitter discourse captures **a partial and elite-skewed representation** of the protest movement rather than the full spectrum of participant experiences.

---

## 📈 Key Insights
- Protest visibility is shaped by emotionally resonant narratives and network amplification
- High-impact tweets often combine moral framing with clear calls to action
- Sentiment analysis highlights sustained grievance rather than momentary outrage
- Narrative frames help explain how protest discourse sustains momentum over time
